Analysis of student alcohol consumption.

I have defined three resarch questions for this dataset:

*Is there a significant difference between alcohol consumption and the parents education?

*Is there a significant difference between alcohol consumption and the parents job?

*does alcohol consumption during the weekend influence the students final grade?

Assumptions

Many factors are involved in student academic failure. It seems academic failure rate is high in Portuguese secondary school students. Although many factors such as family situation, parent’s occupation, student’s study time, and many other factors are effective, but one of the determining factors is alcohol consumption among Portuguese secondary school students.
The data were obtained in a survey of students math and portuguese language courses in secondary school. It contains a lot of interesting social, gender and study information about students.

Definitions

Attributes for both student-mat.csv (Math course) and student-por.csv (Portuguese language course) datasets.
